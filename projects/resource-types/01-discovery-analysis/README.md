# Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis

This phase focuses on understanding the current ALP resource system and defining requirements for the enhanced resource type system.

## Phase Objectives

1. **Analyze Current State**: Document existing ALP resource types and their limitations
2. **Define Enhanced Requirements**: Specify requirements for new Video and VD SharePoint Folder types
3. **User Story Development**: Create comprehensive user stories for all resource type interactions
4. **Constraint Documentation**: Identify technical, business, and integration constraints

## Phase Deliverables

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [ ] Current Resource Analysis
- [ ] Enhanced Requirements Definition
- [ ] User Stories Documentation
- [ ] Constraints & Assumptions Documentation

## Key Questions to Answer

### Current System Analysis
- What are the current resource types and their attributes?
- How are resources currently associated with offerings/outcomes/components?
- What are the limitations of the current system?
- What integration points exist with external systems?

### Enhanced Requirements
- What new capabilities are needed for Video resources?
- How should VD SharePoint Folders integrate with existing SharePoint systems?
- What metadata is required for each resource type?
- What search and filtering capabilities are needed?

### User Experience
- How do users currently discover and access resources?
- What are the pain points in the current resource system?
- What new user workflows are enabled by enhanced resource types?
- How should type-specific actions be presented in the UI?

### Technical Constraints
- What are the database schema constraints?
- What are the performance requirements?
- What security and access control requirements exist?
- What integration requirements exist with external systems?

## Success Criteria

This phase is complete when:
- [ ] All current ALP resource types are documented and analyzed
- [ ] Requirements for new resource types are clearly defined
- [ ] User stories cover all resource type interactions
- [ ] Technical and business constraints are identified and documented
- [ ] Stakeholder review and approval is obtained

## Next Phase

Upon completion, proceed to **Phase 2: Design & Planning** where we will:
- Design Vue component architecture for each resource type
- Create UI wireframes and interaction patterns
- Define TypeScript data models and interfaces
- Plan integration patterns with the portal system
