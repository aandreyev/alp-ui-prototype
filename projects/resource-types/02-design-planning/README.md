# Phase 2: Design & Planning

This phase creates detailed architectural and interaction designs based on the comprehensive analysis completed in Phase 1.

## Phase Objectives

1. **Component Architecture Design**: Define component hierarchy and integration patterns
2. **User Experience Design**: Create detailed user journey maps and interaction patterns  
3. **Technical Implementation Strategy**: Plan production-ready implementation approach
4. **Integration Planning**: Design seamless integration with existing ALP patterns

## Phase Deliverables

## Design Principles (From Phase 1 Analysis)

### Core Design Principles
Based on our Resource Management Design Principles analysis:

1. **Type-Specific Specialization**: Each resource type has unique display and interaction patterns
2. **Consistent Base Patterns**: Common actions and metadata across all types
3. **Context-Aware Display**: Resources adapt based on association context (offering/outcome/component)
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show essential info first, detailed metadata on demand
5. **Integration-First Design**: Seamless integration with existing ALP patterns

### Key Insights from Phase 1 Analysis

#### From Syntaq Form Integration Analysis:
- Forms require specialized analytics display (submission count, completion rate)
- Integration with external Syntaq API for real-time data
- Category-based organization (marketing, sales, vd, admin, client)

#### From SharePoint Integration Analysis:
- Current SharePoint integration is basic (folder names only)
- Enhanced VD SharePoint Folders need rich metadata and content synchronization
- Status-based folder organization must be preserved
- User authentication patterns need improvement

#### From Resource Field Analysis:
- 6 comprehensive resource types with detailed metadata structures
- Common base fields across all types (BaseEntity + CommonResourceMetadata)
- Type-specific enhanced metadata for rich functionality
- Advanced analytics and performance tracking capabilities

## Architecture Foundation

### Component Integration Points
Based on existing portal resources system:
- **ResourceCard.vue**: Main container for type-specific display
- **ResourceDetailModal.vue**: Detailed view integration
- **ResourceFilters.vue**: Type-specific filtering capabilities
- **EnhancedOutcomesTab.vue**: Context-aware resource display within Matters

### Data Architecture
From Resource Field Analysis:
- **BaseResourceFields**: Common audit and tracking fields
- **CommonResourceMetadata**: Shared classification and usage tracking
- **Type-Specific Interfaces**: Enhanced metadata for each resource type
- **Association Metadata**: Entity relationship management

## Success Criteria

This phase is complete when:
- [ ] Component architecture follows ALP patterns and integrates seamlessly
- [ ] User journeys are validated against Phase 1 user stories
- [ ] Technical implementation plan is feasible and production-ready
- [ ] Integration strategy preserves existing functionality while adding enhancements
- [ ] All designs follow ALP consistency standards
- [ ] Stakeholder review and approval obtained

## Next Phase

Upon completion, proceed to **Phase 3: Implementation** where we will:
- Set up ALP-compatible workspace with realistic test data
- Build production-ready Vue components following our designs
- Implement iterative development with continuous testing
- Create comprehensive testing environment
