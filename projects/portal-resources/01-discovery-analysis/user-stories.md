### Epic 1: Resource Discovery & Access

#### Story 1.1: Access Matter Resources
**As a** legal professional working on a matter
**I want to** see all resources associated with this matter in the place, and at the time, I need it (i.e. at point-of-need). I don't want to have to go looking for reseources in separate systems, such as precedent folders, email template folders, etc. I want the relevant template available to me as and when I need it to complete a step in a Matter 
**So that** I can quickly access relevant documents, forms, and templates at the point-of-need and efficiently get the Matter completed

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Resources organized by hierarchy (Offering → Outcome → Component). When I am at the top level of the Resources tab, I want to see all of the Resources for the Matter set out in a way that makes it clear what resources I will be using at what points in the Matter.

**As a** legal professional
**I want to** be able to look at the Resources tab and immediately see all of the resources that I will be using to complete the Offerings within the Matter. I want to see what resources will be required to deliver each offering, outcome and component. I want to be able to click on the various resources and access them directly
