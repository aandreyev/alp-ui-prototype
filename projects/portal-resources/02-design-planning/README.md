## Design Principles

- **Consistency**: Follow existing ALP UI patterns and shadcn/ui (New York variant)
- **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance
- **Performance**: Optimize for enterprise application performance
- **Scalability**: Design for future feature additions
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing ALP workflows

## Completion Criteria
