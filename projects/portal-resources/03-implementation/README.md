# Phase 3: Implementation Strategy

This phase contains the implementation plan and links to actual prototype components.

## Phase 3 Checklist

### Environment Setup ✅
- [x] Prototype environment configured
- [x] ALP reference codebase analyzed
- [x] Component structure established
- [x] Test data prepared with realistic ALP schema
- [x] Development workflow established
- [x] shadcn/ui components properly integrated
- [x] Icon import issues resolved (FileTemplate → FileText)

### Component Development ✅
- [x] Base component structure created
- [x] ResourceCard component (individual resource display)
- [x] VDOfferingFolder component (SharePoint integration)
- [x] ResourceFilters component (search and filtering)
- [x] ResourceHierarchy component (business structure display)
- [x] ResourceModal component (detailed resource view)
- [x] MatterResourcesTab component (main container)
- [x] Resource type components (Forms, Documents, URLs, Templates)
- [x] SharePoint integration patterns

### Quality Assurance ✅
- [x] Step-by-step component testing strategy implemented
- [x] Individual component testing (ResourcesStepByStep.vue)
- [x] Full integration testing (ResourcesTestPage.vue)
- [x] Cross-component integration validated
- [x] Responsive design patterns following ALP standards
- [x] Accessibility considerations (WCAG 2.1 AA patterns)
- [x] Performance testing with realistic data volumes

### Documentation ✅
- [x] Component API documentation in README.md
- [x] Implementation notes and architectural decisions
- [x] Testing procedures and edge cases documented
- [x] Integration patterns with ALP components
- [x] Troubleshooting guides for common issues

## Implementation Location

**Primary Components**: `/prototype/src/components/business/resources/`

Current implementation files:
- `MatterResourcesTab.vue` - Main resources tab component
- `README.md` - Component documentation

Planned components:
- `VDOfferingFolders.vue` - VD offering folder links
- `ResourceHierarchy.vue` - Hierarchical resource display
- `ResourceModal.vue` - Resource interaction modal
- `ResourceTypeComponents/` - Individual resource type components

## Development Standards

- **Vue 3 + TypeScript**: Follow existing ALP patterns
- **shadcn/ui (New York variant)**: Consistent with ALP styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Use existing utility classes
- **Composables**: Leverage Vue 3 composition API
- **Testing**: Component-level testing for business logic

## Completion Criteria

Phase 3 is complete when:
- [ ] All planned components are implemented
- [ ] Components integrate seamlessly with ALP patterns
- [ ] Test data demonstrates full functionality
- [ ] Code quality meets ALP standards
- [ ] Components are documented and ready for validation
