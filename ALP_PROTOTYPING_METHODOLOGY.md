# ALP Component Prototyping Methodology

A comprehensive, AI-assisted methodology for developing enterprise UI components within the ALP (Australian Legal Practice) system.

## üéØ Methodology Overview

This methodology provides a structured approach for prototyping complex enterprise UI components that integrate seamlessly with existing ALP systems. It emphasizes thorough planning, iterative development, and validation against real business requirements.

### Core Principles

1. **Start Simple First**: Begin with the simplest possible solution that works
2. **Component Reuse is King**: Always look for opportunities to reuse existing components
3. **Standard Design Patterns**: Adopt proven patterns rather than creating custom solutions
4. **Context-First Development**: Understand existing patterns before creating new ones
5. **Business Value Focus**: Every component must solve a real business problem
6. **Integration-Ready**: Components must be production-ready, not just demos
7. **AI-Assisted Efficiency**: Leverage AI for rapid iteration while maintaining quality
8. **Enterprise Standards**: Follow ALP's existing patterns and conventions

## ü§ñ AI Assistant Guidelines

### Critical Success Factors for AI Implementation

1. **Always Ask Before Major Changes**
   - Never implement whole component libraries without approval
   - Confirm architectural decisions before proceeding
   - Validate approach against existing ALP patterns using resources in ALP-reference folder and alp documentation folder

2. **Copy, Don't Create**
   - Use ALP's existing shadcn/ui components exactly as they are. Copy them to the prototype environment
   - Follow ALP's import patterns and file structure
   - Leverage existing CSS classes and styling conventions

3. **Test with Real Components, Not HTML**
   - Build actual Vue components for testing
   - Use realistic data structures and volumes
   - Test integration scenarios, not isolated demos

4. **Document Decisions Immediately**
   - Record architectural choices while context is fresh
   - Update methodology based on lessons learned
   - Maintain clear rationale for future reference

### Consolidation Memory Pattern

**Key Learning**: Create summary documents at the end of each stage to prevent knowledge loss and ensure smooth handoffs.

- ‚úÖ **Stage 1 Analysis Summary**: Consolidate all discovery findings into a single document for Stage 2
- ‚úÖ **Stage 2 Design Summary**: Consolidate all design decisions into a single document for Stage 3
- ‚úÖ **Stage 3 Implementation Summary**: Consolidate all implementation details for Stage 4 (if needed)

**Purpose of Consolidation**:
- **Prevent Knowledge Loss**: Detailed analysis in each stage doesn't get lost
- **Smooth Handoffs**: Next stage has all essential information in one place
- **Decision Context**: Maintain rationale for key architectural decisions
- **Future Reference**: Single source of truth for project decisions

**What to Include in Summaries**:
- **Key Findings**: Most important insights from the stage
- **Critical Decisions**: Architectural and design choices made
- **Dependencies**: What the next stage needs to know
- **Constraints**: Limitations and requirements that affect future work
- **Success Criteria**: How to measure success in the next stage

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ‚ùå Creating custom UI components when ALP has existing ones
- ‚ùå Building HTML demos instead of Vue component tests
- ‚ùå Implementing without understanding existing patterns
- ‚ùå Making architectural changes without approval
- ‚ùå Focusing on technical perfection over business value
- ‚ùå **Losing stage analysis in detailed documents** - Always create consolidation summaries

### Efficiency Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Start with existing ALP patterns and extend them
- ‚úÖ Use step-by-step testing approaches for complex components
- ‚úÖ Build incrementally with continuous validation
- ‚úÖ Leverage AI for rapid iteration while maintaining quality
- ‚úÖ Focus on integration readiness from day one

### Component Reuse Strategy

**Key Learning**: Always look for opportunities to reuse components rather than creating separate ones.

- ‚úÖ **Single Reusable Component Pattern**: Create one component that handles multiple scenarios via props
- ‚úÖ **Configuration-Driven Behavior**: Use configuration objects to drive component behavior
- ‚úÖ **Type-Specific Sub-Components**: Break out only the truly unique parts into small config components
- ‚úÖ **Shared Logic in Composables**: Extract common functionality into reusable composables

**Example**: Instead of 18 separate components (6 list pages + 6 add modals + 6 edit modals), create:
- 3 reusable core components (list, add modal, edit modal)
- 6 small type-specific config components
- Shared composables for common logic

**Benefits**:
- 90% code reuse for common functionality
- Single source of truth for shared logic
- Consistent UX across all variations
- Much easier maintenance and updates

### Standard Design Patterns to Adopt

**Key Learning**: Use proven patterns rather than inventing custom solutions.

- ‚úÖ **Props-Based Configuration**: Pass behavior via props rather than creating separate components
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Component Loading**: Use `<component :is="componentName">` for type-specific sections
- ‚úÖ **Configuration Objects**: Define behavior through structured configuration rather than code duplication
- ‚úÖ **Composable Pattern**: Extract shared logic into Vue 3 composables
- ‚úÖ **Slot-Based Customization**: Use slots for customizable sections while maintaining structure

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**:
- ‚ùå Creating separate components for each variation when props could handle differences
- ‚ùå Duplicating logic across similar components
- ‚ùå Hard-coding behavior that could be configuration-driven
- ‚ùå Building custom solutions when standard patterns exist

### Start Simple First Strategy

**Key Learning**: Begin with the simplest possible solution that works, then enhance incrementally.

- ‚úÖ **Simple List Before Complex Views**: Start with basic table layouts before adding advanced features
- ‚úÖ **Single Form Before Wizard Steps**: Begin with simple single-page forms before multi-step wizards
- ‚úÖ **Static Before Dynamic**: Build with static data first, then add dynamic behavior
- ‚úÖ **Core Features Before Nice-to-Haves**: Implement essential functionality before advanced features

**Simple First Approach**:
1. **Phase 1**: Basic CRUD operations with simple forms and tables
2. **Phase 2**: Add search, filtering, and pagination
3. **Phase 3**: Add advanced features like bulk operations, import/export
4. **Phase 4**: Add analytics, reporting, and optimization

**Benefits**:
- Faster time to working prototype
- Earlier stakeholder feedback
- Reduced complexity and risk
- Clear progression path for enhancements
- Easier to identify what's truly needed vs nice-to-have

**Example**: For resource management, start with:
- Simple list page with basic table
- Simple add/edit modals with essential fields only
- Basic search functionality
- Then progressively add: advanced filtering, bulk operations, analytics, etc.
